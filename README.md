# Alcohol Breathalyzer 

Electronics project (hardware only) to design and implement an alcohol breathalyzer with an analog-only component constraint. For complete documentation, refer to the final_report.pdf.

# TINA Schematics

To simulate the analog signal processing of the sensor output, the circuit functional groups were modelled in TINA as shown below.
